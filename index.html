**Step 4: Commit Your Changes**
At the bottom of the page:
- In the first box, write a brief message like "Create homepage"
- Leave the second box empty
- Make sure "Commit directly to the main branch" is selected
- Click "Commit new file"

### What is a "Commit"?
A commit is like saving a snapshot of your work. Each time you commit, GitHub saves the state of your files along with a message describing what you changed. This creates a history you can look back on or revert to if needed.

## Editing Files

To edit any file in your repository:

**Step 1: Open the File**
Click on the filename in your repository's file list.

**Step 2: Click Edit**
Click the pencil icon (✏️) on the right side, labeled "Edit this file".

**Step 3: Make Your Changes**
Edit the content in the text editor.

**Step 4: Commit Your Changes**
Scroll down, add a commit message describing what you changed, and click "Commit changes".

## Creating Folders

GitHub doesn't have a "create folder" button. Instead, you create folders by including them in a filename:

**Step 1: Create a New File**
Click "Add file" → "Create new file".

**Step 2: Type a Path**
In the filename box, type: `chapters/chapter-01.html`

When you type the forward slash (`/`), GitHub automatically creates the "chapters" folder.

**Step 3: Add Content and Commit**
Add your content and commit the file as usual.

💡 **Tip: Organizing Your Files**
A typical structure for course materials might look like:
```
my-course-materials/
├── index.html (homepage)
├── chapters/
│   ├── chapter-01.html
│   ├── chapter-02.html
│   └── chapter-03.html
├── images/
│   ├── diagram-01.png
│   └── logo.png
└── styles/
    └── main.css
